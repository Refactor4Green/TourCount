# TourCount

TourCount is an Android app that supports species-specific counting of butterflies in nature.

The integrated database is organized according to a tour in nature with its expected butterfly species. That means, a new (importable and prepared) basic database instance will be used per tour.

Databases can be individually created and adapted regarding meta data and expected butterfly species. The recorded data (meta data, counts, species data and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone or exported in SQLite- or CSV-format and transferred to a PC for your own processing, e.g. by importing a csv-file into MS Excel.

The app demands for storage access permit which is needed for im-/exporting the counting data, GPS permit for location info per count and the permit to prevent the phone from sleeping (to control the counting screen when used under Android 5.0.1 or newer).

A detailed description for setting up and using the app as well as a sample basic database (tourcount0.db) is provided under 'docs'.

The apk-file 'tourcount-release.apk' is provided under 'apk'. It is usable with Android Version 4.2.2 or newer.

Before using the app, please, read the documentation (provided in German and English).
