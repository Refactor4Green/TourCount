  % 1. Introduction
  !
  ! This counting app should support you when recording butterflies. It allows to register individuals species-specific, separated by sexus and metamorphic stages as well as individually localized in the field. It facilitates this comfortably without field book and pencil on every stay in nature.
  _ 
  ! The integrated database can be individually created and adapted regarding expected butterfly species.
  ! The recorded data (meta-data, counts and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone for transfer into the butterfly registration system or transferred to a PC for your own processing.
  _ 
  ! The app is open source (published under <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount</a>), has no tracking or advertising functions, demands only for permissions which are needed for recording the data.
  ! (Access rights for storage, internet for reverse geocoding and GPS.)

  % 2. Setting up
  !
  ! Before initial use you should adapt the settings to your liking. 
  _ 
  ! Then you should edit the preliminary species list. (Use the Pencil-Button in the action bar of the counting page for this). Here you may add more species per (+)-Button from an integrated list of european species.
  _ 
  ! Alternatively, you could download a more comprehensive or special example Basic DB (see <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs</a>). Copy it to your home directory /storage/emulated/0 (or /sdcard0, or /sdcard, it differs between smartphone models and Android versions), then import and adapt it.
  _ 
  ! Then you may enter universal parts of the master data under “PREPARE RECORDING” and finish this by clicking the saving symbol. Location-related meta data derived from GPS coordinates will be inserted automatically, when reverse geocoding is activated under “Settings”. The editable meta data may be modified anytime later. 
  _ 
  ! Then edit the species list on "COUNTING". Use the Pencil-Button in the action bar for that.
  ! Add an entry by the (+)-Button and enter a name and a code (five-digit with leading zeros). Repeat this for each expected species, e.g.:
  _ 
  ! ---------------------------------------------
  ! ...
  ! Pieris napi ................ 07000
  ! Pieris rapae .............. 06998
  ! Pieris na./ra.-compl.	07000*
  ! ...
  _ 
  ! The codes will be used as an option to sort the list and as a reference to show corresponding butterfly pictures on the counting and results page.
  ! The codes derive from the numbering scheme of european butterflies by Karsholt/Razowski, as used e.g. in the German Lepiforum <a href="http://www.lepiforum.de" target="_blank">http://www.lepiforum.de</a> (also see docs in GitHub).
  ! An appended *-symbol marks a group of similar species. It is a good idea to choose the bigger code of the species of this group for sorting.
  ! Click "Save List" to store the input into the database. This list can be changed or supplemented anytime afterwards.
  _ 
  ! When you have entered the meta data and created the counting list for all expected species, the database is ready for export as your "Basic Database".
  ! To do this, you can use the function "Export as Basic DB" in the menu of the starting page. After that you have a copy of the empty database saved as "Basic Database" (tourcount0.db) within the home directory.
  _ 
  ! The Basic DB may be used as a template for further tour recordings. You may export the Basic DB anytime later, e.g. when you inserted new species.

  % 3. Usage
  !
  ! Start with PREPARE RECORDIMG. Fill in the relevant meta data for the specific tour. You may enter the current date and time by clicking the related field or enter any date and time by long pressing the related field. Finish with the SAVE-button. 
  _ 
  ! Then select COUNTING. Select the species by clicking the species line to scroll down the species list.
  ! To count just tip on the corresponding (+)-Button of the seen category (♂ od. ♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva, egg) of the species.
  ! The counter will increment and a page opens to enter individual data. Location info, latitude, longitude, height as well as date and time will be added automatically. Location may be edited and state info as well as multiple counts may be applied here. Go back to the counting page by clicking the "Save" button.
  ! The (-)-Buttons allows for corrections. Mind that the (-)-Buttons reduce the individuals list in a last-in-first-out-mode for the corresponding species category. 
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button in the action bar of the counting page opens the counting list editing page for editing the list of species. 
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button on top of the counting field opens the species editing page that lets you add a remark for each species that will be shown aside of it. 
  _ 
  ! To move back one page you can use the Back-Button or arrow in the left upper corner. To make sure to save edited content you should go back by clicking the Save-Button. 
  ! You should leave TourCount always from its starting page, as in this state the database is safely closed.
  _ 
  ! Some app pages have a specific context menu. You can activate it with the 3-point-symbol in the upper right corner.
  _ 
  ! When you have a large list or have collected big amounts of data the start of pages may be delayed, especially when entering the the results page, as those need heavy calculations.
  _ 
  ! On the Starting page you can open the results page with SHOW RESULTS. It shows all the registered data orderly arranged. Beneath the meta data it shows the totals followed by a list of all counted species with their individual records.

  % 4. Further functions
  !
  ! The menu on the starting page has Settings, Reset, Import, Export, Info and Help functions. 
  _ 
  ! In "Settings" you may adapt the look an feel in some aspects to your wishes, e.g. sounds, sorting order or left-/right-hand counting. 
  _ 
  ! Selecting an own background picture can be achieved by the Gallery App, accessible in the left side menu of the background option (if applicable wipe from left edge).
  _ 
  ! Reverse Geocoding allows for automatic insertion of statements of place (postal code, city, place) into meta data and location into the individual data.
  ! For Reverse Geocoding (to produce address info from GPS coordinates) the free service of Nomination from OpenStreetMap is used. A valid own email address is necessary for durably reliable queries of address data and to exclude abuse. The mail address will be treated confidentially and will only be used to contact you in case of service problems. 
  ! For more info see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim" target="_blank">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim</a>.
  _ 
  ! For preparing a new tour you may use “Reset Data” to reset the tour-specific meta data and all count data. Alternatively you may import the Basic DB "tourcount0.db". 
  _ 
  ! Internally, TourCount stores the data always in a single, equally named DB-file in the app's own storage area that is not accessible by the user. Therefore, exporting the data to files in a user reachable storage area is necessary.
  _ 
  ! Exporting the DB as empty "Basic DB" is reasonable, when lasting changes of the counting list have been made (e.g. new species added).
  _ 
  ! You may import any previously exported TourCount-DB. This supports monitoring on different tours. To achieve this you may create tour-specific Basic DBs which may be renamed by a file manager into e.g. tourcount1.db, tourcount2.db, etc. (Mind: The db file name must start with “tourcount”, otherwise the file cannot be imported).
  _ 
  ! Exporting the current database (Export DB) writes a copy of the complete DB to /storage/emulated/0/tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db.
  _ 
  ! The function “Export Data -> CSV File” writes the counting results into a pre-formatted MS Excel readable .csv-file to "/storage/emulated/0/tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.csv".
  _ 
  ! Under "App Info" you find the email address of the author, the history of the app and the license note.
  _ 
  ! The counting page is temporarily switched off using the proximity sensor when the phone is put into a pocket (under Android 5.0.1 or newer). The menu of the counting page provides a "Share" function for sending notes using a standard app, like SMS or email.
  _ 
  ! IT-affine users may transfer the exported "tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db" or "-.csv"-files to a PC. 
  ! There you may examine the db-file with a free tool like "SqliteBrowser" (<a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">http://sqlitebrowser.org</a>) or you may import the .csv-file as UTF-8 comma-delimited text file into Excel for further processing.
