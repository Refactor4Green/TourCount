Installing the App

Download either from F-Droid store,
(app only but with future updates from F-Droid store)
or get the app directly from GitHub (most up to date development status). 

F-Droid store:
https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.wmstein.tourcount
After installing from F-Droid you should download the docs and Basic DBs from GitHub. 
Docs and Basic DBs are only downloadable per link to GitHub.

GitHub:
On GitHub the author publishes the complete project with app, source code, docs and prepared Basic DBs in German and English:

Project page:   https://github.com/wistein/TourCount
App (apk-file):  https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/apk
Docs, DBs, SQL-Scripts:   https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs

In any case, before installation you must activate the option "Unknown sources" on your phone under "Settings -> Security".

After download you can install the app by a file or download manager from the download directory.
Copy the Basic DB data files from the download directory to the basic directory (/storage/emulated/0).

Important: Thereafter, deactivate the option "Unknown sources"!

Remarks on F-Droid App Store:
Usage of the F-Droid store is as safe as Google's Play Store.
Privacy is a concern and all apps are checked and compiled by F-Droid. 
Antifeatures like Ads, tracking or hidden costs will be listet in the app's description.

The apk file (installable app) published under GitHub is functional identic with the one of F-Droid. 
But there is a difference in the compilation key. Therefore an installed apk file from GitHub cannot be updated by an apk file from F-Droid and vice versa.
In case you change the installation source you have to reinstall the app.


Tips

To prepare or modify database files of TourCount you may find the free tool "DB Browser for SQLite" helpful.
It is available among others for Windows, OSX, Linux and Android. 
For example, you may create new entries or sort or correct existing entries.

Prepared scripts (*.sql) exist for:
 - sort species list of basic database tourcount0.db by code
 - sort species list of any other tourcount*.db database by code
