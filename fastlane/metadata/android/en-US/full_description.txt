TourCount supports species-specific and individually localized registering of butterflies. 

Features
- Data recording is organized for a regional tour with its expected butterfly species.
- The app comes with a prepared basic database with the most common species in Europe as a starting point.
- Databases can be individually created and adapted within the app regarding meta data and expected butterfly species.
- You may use an individual species list per region.
- The app contains an editor to setup or adapt the current species list,
- an editor to prepare the meta data for a tour,
- an editor for individual species data of a count (e.g. state, remark or bulk count entry).
- Species can be selected per scroll-down-menu on the counting page which has
- separate counters for ♂ or ♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva or egg.
- The app automaticaly inserts date, time, coordinates and height as well as
- location data by reverse OSM-geocoding when GPS and internet are accessible.
- Results are prepared for easy readout to transfer them to the science4you entry mask for butterfly registration.
- Results are shown with meta data, totals, remarks, species results and individual data.
- Results may be exported in SQLite- or CSV-format (for transfer to a PC for your own processing, e.g. in a spreadsheet.)
- Help contains a detailed userguide.
- TourCount uses the European coding scheme for butterflies from Karsholt/Razowski.

Prerequisites
The app demands for 
- storage access permit which is needed for im-/exporting the counting data, 
- GPS permit for coordinates and location info per count, 
- internet access for OpenStreetMap reverse geocoding, 
- the permit to write settings for setting the screen brightness,
- the permit to keep the device awake and to switch off the counting screen when the phone is pocketed.
The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app is usable with Android version 4.2.2 or newer.
